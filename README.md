# AEM URL Switcher

A Chrome extension designed to enhance AEM development by allowing easy switching between AEM editor, publish, and CRX DE URLs, with the ability to manage multiple server environments and unique color-coded tab groups for each server.

## Features
1. **Switch URLs**: Quickly toggle between editor, publish, and CRX DE modes for AEM pages.
2. **Multiple Servers**: Manage and switch between multiple server environments with ease.
3. **Unique Color-Coded Servers**: Each server can be assigned a unique color. The servers are listed down in the extension popup with color coding to help easy recognition. 
4. **Tab Groups**: When switching to a mode/server in the extension popup, the page opens in a tab group that reflects the color of the selected server, making it easier to visually distinguish between environments.
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow with handy shortcuts to switch modes:
   - **Switch to Editor**: `Ctrl+Shift+E`
   - **Switch to Publish**: `Ctrl+Shift+Z`
   - **Switch to CRX DE**: `Ctrl+Shift+X`
